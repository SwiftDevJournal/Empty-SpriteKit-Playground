# Empty-SpriteKit-Playground

An iOS SpriteKit game playground with the Apple boilerplate code removed so you can start prototyping your game idea.

When you create a SpriteKit game playground or project in Xcode, the template includes a "Hello World" label and code that displays spinning sprites when you tap the screen. You end up having to remove this code and the label to start making your game. This playground removes the code and label for you. 

## Showing the Live View

The playground's live view shows the game scene so it's important that the playground shows the live view. Without the live view visible, you can't play the game.

Above the editor where you type the source code is the jump bar. On the right side of the jump bar are two small buttons. Click the left button and make sure there's a checkmark next to Live View. If not, choose Live View.

Below the Live View menu item that appears when clicking the left button is a Layout item. Click that button to specify whether the live view appears next to the editor or below the editor.

## Using the Scene Editor

The playground comes with an empty scene you can fill using the scene editor. The project navigator should be visible on the left side of the window. If it's not, press Cmd-1 to show it.

There is a Resources folder in the project navigator. Click the disclosure triangle next to the folder to show the files in the folder. Select the `GameScene.sks` file to open the scene and edit it.

There is an Add button in the upper right corner of the window. Click that button to access the library of items you can add to the scene. Option-click the Add button to keep the Library window from going away.

Drag an item from the Library window to the scene to add it to the scene. Select an item in the scene to move it.

When using the scene editor, it helps to have the inspector view visible on the right side of the window. Click the button in the upper right corner of the window to toggle showing and hiding the inspector.
